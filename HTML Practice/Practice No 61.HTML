        <p>In HTML, It is used to define a block of text that is a quotation
            from another source. It is typically used for longer quotations and
            is rendered with indentation to set it apart from the surrounding
            text. The blockquote tag is commonly used for citing sources in
            articles, essays, or any content where long quotes are included</p>
