        <p>In the equation <var>x</var> + 5 = 10, the variable <var>x</var> can
            be solved to find its value.</p>
        <p>In HTML, It is used to define a variable in a mathematical expression
            or in programming contexts. The text within the var tag is typically
            rendered in an italicized font by default, making it visually
            distinct from regular text. This tag is semantically meaningful,
            indicating that the enclosed text is a variable.</p>
