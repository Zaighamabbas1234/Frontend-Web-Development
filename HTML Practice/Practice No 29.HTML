        <h1>Jupyter Notebook:</h1>
        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p2>The history of Jupyter Notebook goes back to the year 2001 when
            Fernando Perez started the development of I Python.
            <br>
            <hr>
            A command shell for Python that provides interactive computing
            functionalities.
            <br>
            <hr>
            In 2007, the I Python team started the development of a notebook
            system based on I Python for combining text, calculations,
            visualizations and a first version was released in 2011.
            <br>
            <hr>
            In 2014, the notebook part was split off from I Python and became
            Project Jupyter, with I Python being the most common kernel for
            Jupyter but not the only one.
            <br>
            <hr>
            There now exist kernels to provide programming language support for
            Jupyter notebooks for many common languages including Ruby, Python
            and R.</p2>

        <p3>Jupyter Notebooks are a community standard for communicating and
            performing interactive computing.
            <br>
            <hr>
            They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explanatory
            text, mathematics, images and rich media representations of objects.
            <br>
            <hr>
            Jupyter Lab is one interface used to create and interact with
            Jupyter Notebooks.
            <br>
            <hr>
            "Jupyter" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python and R.
            <br>
            <hr>
            These programming languages were the first target languages of the
            Jupyter application.
            <br>
            <hr>
            The main components of the whole environment are on the one hand,
            the notebooks themselves and the application.</p3>
