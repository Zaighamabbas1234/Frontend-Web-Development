        <h1>Jupyter Notebook:</h1>
        <!-- This is the history of Jupyter Notebook. -->
        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p2>The history of Jupyter Notebook goes back to the year 2001 when
            Fernando Perez started the development of I Python.<br>A command
            shell for Python that provides interactive computing
            functionalities.<br>In 2007, the I Python team started the
            development of a notebook system based on I Python for combining
            text, calculations, visualizations and a first version was released
            in 2011.<br>In 2014, the notebook part was split off from I Python
            and became Project Jupyter, with I Python being the most common
            kernel for Jupyter but not the only one.<br>There now exist kernels
            to provide programming language support for Jupyter notebooks for
            many common languages including Ruby, Perl and Java etc.</p2>
        <!-- This is the introduction of the jupyter notebook. -->
        <h3>Forward:</h3>
        <p3>Jupyter Notebooks are a community standard for communicating and
            performing interactive computing.<br>They are a document that blends
            computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images and
            rich media representations of objects.<br>Jupyter Lab is one
            interface used to create and interact with Jupyter
            Notebooks.<br>"Jupyter" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python and
            R.<br>These programming languages were the first target languages of
            the Jupyter application.<br>The main components of the whole
            environment are on the one hand, the notebooks themselves and the
            application.</p3>
