        <p>In HTML, It is used to encapsulate media elements (such as images,
            diagrams, illustrations, or videos) along with their captions. It is
            typically used in conjunction with the figcaption tag, which
            provides a caption or description for the content inside the figure
            tag. The figure element helps to semantically group related content
            together and ensures that the caption is associated with the
            media.</p>
