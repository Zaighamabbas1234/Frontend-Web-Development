            <h1>Biography:</h1>
            <p>The history of Jupyter Notebook goes back to the year 2001 when
                Fernando Perez started the development of I Python, a command
                shell for Python that provides interactive computing
                functionalities. In 2007, the I Python team started the
                development of a notebook system based on I Python for combining
                text, calculations, visualizations and a first version was
                released in 2011. In 2014, the notebook part was split off from
                I Python and became Project Jupyter, with I Python being the
                most common kernel for Jupyter but not the only one. There now
                exist kernels to provide programming language support for
                Jupyter notebooks for many common languages including Ruby, Perl
                and Java etc.</p>

            <p>Jupyter Notebooks are a community standard for communicating and
                performing interactive computing. They are a document that
                blends computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics,
                images and rich media representations of objects. Jupyter Lab is
                one interface used to create and interact with Jupyter
                Notebooks. "Jupyter" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python
                and R. These programming languages were the first target
                languages of the Jupyter application. The main components of the
                whole environment are on the one hand, the notebooks themselves
                and the application.</p>
