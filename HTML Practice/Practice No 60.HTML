        <p>The term <dfn>HTML</dfn> stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which
            is used to create web pages.</p>
        <p>In HTML, It is used to define a term that is being introduced or
            explained in the document. It is typically used alongside the abbr
            and cite tags to provide context for the term or concept being
            discussed. The text inside a dfn tag is usually styled in italics by
            default, although you can customize this with CSS.</p>
