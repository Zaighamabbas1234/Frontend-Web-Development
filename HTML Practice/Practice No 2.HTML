        <h1>Jupyter Notebook:</h1>
        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p2>The history of Jupyter Notebook goes back to the year 2001 when
            Fernando Perez started the development of I Python, a command shell
            for Python that provides interactive computing functionalities. In
            2007, the I Python team started the development of a notebook system
            based on I Python for combining text, calculations, visualizations
            and a first version was released in 2011. In 2014, the notebook part
            was split off from I Python and became Project Jupyter, with I
            Python being the most common kernel for Jupyter but not the only
            one. There now exist kernels to provide programming language support
            for Jupyter notebooks for many common languages including Ruby, Perl
            and Java etc.</p2>
        <h3>Forward:</h3>
        <p3>Jupyter Notebooks are a community standard for communicating and
            performing interactive computing. They are a document that blends
            computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images and
            rich media representations of objects. Jupyter Lab is one interface
            used to create and interact with Jupyter Notebooks. "Jupyter" is a
            loose acronym meaning Julia, Python and R. These programming
            languages were the first target languages of the Jupyter
            application. The main components of the whole environment are on the
            one hand, the notebooks themselves and the application.</p3>
